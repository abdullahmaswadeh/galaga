# Galaga
Galaga is a Japanese shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Namco Japan and by Midway in North America in 1981. 
It is the sequel to 1979's Galaxian. 

The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. 
The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. 

Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to crash into them. 

In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, or being captured.
